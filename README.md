This project is a simple distance measuring system using an infrared (IR) sensor and a
light dependent resistor (LDR). The IR sensor detects the presence of an object and
calculates the distance between the sensor and the object based on the time taken for
the IR signal to bounce back. The LDR measures the ambient light intensity and adjusts
the LED brightness accordingly.
The system is built using an 8051 microcontroller and uses 4 LEDs and a buzzer to
indicate the distance between the sensor and the object. When an object is detected at
a distance of 10 cm or less, all 4 LEDs light up and the buzzer sounds an alarm.
Otherwise, all LEDs are turned off and the buzzer is silent.
In addition to the distance measurement, this project also demonstrates the use of a
potentiometer to vary the detection threshold of the IR sensor. This allows for the
detection range to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the application.
